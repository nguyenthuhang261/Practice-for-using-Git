- How to make your text _italic_
    - Click letter "_I_" and then it will appear somthing like this ![p2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0355109-878a-45d9-b54a-95e9881688a4) or you can type directly "_i_" (put "i" into this "_ _").
- How to make your text **_bold and italic_**
    - Just click in both of two letters "**B**" and "_I_" and then it will appear something like this ![p3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4598382f-0815-4d78-927c-4270425a56fe) or you can type directly "_bold and italic_" (put "bold and italic" into this "_ **** _").
